		<p1>Welcome to my week one MI 349 website. My name is Sam Beauregard and I am a senior student at Michigan State University. I am from Spring Lake Michigan which is close to Grand Haven or Muskegon if you haven't heard of Spring Lake. Some of my hobbies include reading, skiing, playing video games, or binge watching netflix shows. I have some experience with HTML and CSS but am a little rusty.</p1>
